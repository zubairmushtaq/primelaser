              <p>I have to admit, I used to depend on makeup for a good complexion. But not anymore. Now I’m focused on correcting my skin for a more radiant complexion –without makeup. So are you ready to be makeup-free? Are you ready for Prime
                skin?
                <br><br>
                During our complimentary consultations, I help our guests select the best services and products to correct what bothers them about their skin. It’s important for guests to understand that beautiful skin doesn’t happen overnight.
                Depending on the extent of the damage, it could take a combination of medical grade products, a series of laser treatments, and for some, injectables like Botox and dermal fillers to achieve the desired results. It really just comes
                down to each individual’s goals and budget which we discuss during the consultation.
                <br><br>
                There are many factors I take into consideration when putting together a treatment plan for a guest. The

              <p>Common Skincare Concern Series: Fine Lines and Wrinkles
                Wrinkles are creases, folds or ridges in the skin that mostly occur on parts of the body that get the most sun exposure: face, neck, back of the hands and top of the forearms. Wrinkles are a by-product of the aging process. Several
                natural changes in aging skin contribute to the development of fine lines and wrinkles:
                <br><br>
                Skin cells divide more slowly
                The dermis becomes thinner
                The network of connective tissue—collagen and elastin—begins to loosen and unravel, causing depressions to form on the skin’s surface
                Your skin loses its elasticity and becomes more fragile
                Oil-secreting glands shrink, reducing your skin’s ability to stay moisturized, leading to dry skin
                Fat in the hypodermis (deepest) layer of your skin decreases
                What Causes Wrinkles?
                <br><br>
                Sun damage. Exposure to UV light breaks down collagen and elastin, causing your skin to lose strength and elasticity. Therefore, your skin sags and wrinkles prematurely. People with fair skin and blue eyes are more susceptible to sun
                damage.
                <br><br>
                Facial expressions. Facial movements or expressions like smiling, frowning or squinting lead to fine lines and wrinkles. Every time you use a facial muscle, a groove forms under your skin. When you’re young, your skin springs back in
                place. As you age, your skin loses its elasticity, so it can’t spring back. Therefore, the grooves become permanent.
                <br><br>
                Smoking. Toxins in cigarette smoke damage collagen and elastin, leading to sagging skin. Smoking can produce free radicals that cause premature wrinkles.
                <br><br>
                Genetics. If your parents developed wrinkles at an earlier age than most people, chances are you will, too.
                <br><br>
                Types of Wrinkles
                <br><br>
                Dynamic wrinkles are lines that appear only when you make a facial expression. Dynamic wrinkles are caused by repeatedly contracting your facial muscles through facial expressions. Muscle contractions cause the skin to bunch
                together, forming lines between the muscles. Dynamic wrinkles are usually the first visible sign of skin aging. They indicate that your skin is starting to lose its elasticity. Examples include:
                <br><br>
                Frowning or furrowing your brow creates deep wrinkle lines between your eyebrows.
                Raising your eyebrows causes the horizontal wrinkle lines on your forehead.
                Smiling and squinting bunch the skin on your cheeks and outer corners of your eyes, forming crow’s feet.
                Static wrinkles are always visible and don’t require facial movement to be seen. Static wrinkles are caused by the loss of skin elasticity due to age, gravity, sun damage, smoking and genetics. Unfortunately, over time most dynamic
                wrinkles become static wrinkles. Examples include:
                <br><br>
                The thinning of the skin around the eyes that begins in your mid-30s and progresses with age
                Cross-hatched appearance of the skin on your cheeks that begins in your late-30s and progresses with age
                Wrinkle folds are caused by the loss of fat under your skin and sagging of the underlying facial structures. Wrinkle folds, such as the deep grooves that run between your nose and mouth (nasal labial groove), are the most common
                wrinkles attributed to the natural aging process.
                <br><br>
                Ways to Prevent Wrinkles
                <br><br>
                Limit sun exposure. Wear sunscreen with at least 30 SPF every day (even on cloudy days or when you’re inside); cover up and avoid peak sun hours.
                <br><br>
                Don’t smoke. Simple as that.
                <br><br>
                Moisturize. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, sunscreen and moisturizer are the two most effective anti-aging products you can buy. Get the most bang for your buck and choose medical grade products that will deliver a
                higher percentage of active ingredients.
                <br><br>
                Sciton Laser Resurfacing Treatments offer a variety of ways to improve tone, texture, fine lines & deep wrinkles, pigmentation & excess freckles, and scars.
                <br><br>
                The SkinPen micro-needling procedure can help to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by assisting your skin’s natural ability to remodel existing collagen and elastin. SkinPen’s procedure can be tailored to your skin’s
                needs and has minimal side effects, so it’s appropriate for most skin types.
                <br><br>
                Bellafill, the 5+ year filler, offers a new level of filler rejuvenation. The collagen immediately adds volume to smooth away facial wrinkles.
                <br><br>
                Biopelle Tensage 40, is a product containing growth factor that delivers the nutrients your skin needs following skincare procedures.

                  skin envy every time I look at her. On this particular day, I was complaining to Twila about my own less-than-perfect complexion. It seems no matter how many different laser treatments Twila has done on me over the years, I still
                  don’t have the beautiful skin I long for, and by that I mean Twila’s skin. Twila listened to me complain for awhile and then gave me a bit of truth to think about. She said Tami, “You will never have my skin no matter what you do.”
                  Huh? That wasn’t very encouraging. She followed up by saying, “You will never have my skin, and I will never have your legs, or Cynde’s butt no matter what I do. All you can strive for is to be the best version of you.” She then
                  reminded me of what my complexion looked like before she got a hold of my face. Between acne scars, brown spots and ruddy cheeks, there was no way I would leave my house without makeup. Even then, I was self-conscious about my
                  skin. Now my acne scars are significantly improved and the brown spots and ruddy cheeks are all cleared up. I wear just a tinted sunscreen now instead of foundation. My kids honestly think I look better now than I did in my 20’s
                  and 30’s. Thank you, Twila!
                  <br><br>
                  That conversation was a reminder to quit comparing myself to everyone else and just be the best version of me I can be, inside and out. Be the best version of you, and if your skin bothers you, come see Twila. You may not walk away
                  with her flawless skin, but I can promise you this. You will have the best skin of your life!

                    I watched the movie The Age of Adaline over Memorial Day weekend, and it got me to thinking about aging. If you’re not familiar with the movie, the main character, Adaline, through some freak accident, stops aging at 29 years
                    old. That would seem to be a dream come true, but as the movie shows, there is a huge downside when it comes to relationships. I don’t want to give the movie away, but I ask you this question. If you could stop the clock at any
                    age, what age would that be and would you choose to do so?
                    <br><br>
                    I’m fast approaching 50 years old, and I’m making it a choice to be okay with that fact and be thankful for that opportunity. Not everyone gets to grow old. “Aging gracefully” is often used as a euphemism to mean, “Looking old,
                    but embracing it” or “Showing signs of aging, but still powering forward with life.” In this day and age though, I don’t think aging gracefully has to mean you have to wear your wrinkles with pride and just accept it. Instead, I
                    think it’s okay to take steps to make your outside appearance match the way you feel on the inside. If that means laser treatments, botox, fillers, or even a facelift then go for it! If you feel energetic and youthful internally,
                    then it makes sense to want to look as great as you feel. But to stop the clock at age 29 or whatever that perfect number is when you looked at felt your best? No thank you. I’ll just take care of myself both inside and out so
                    that I can fully enjoy all the years given to me and look pretty darned good doing so!
                    <br><br>
                    Here’s to aging gracefully,

                      they started. That means that if you start at age 50, when you are 60, you could look 48. The before and after photos documenting this study are amazing. But even more impressive, when dermatologists looked at before and after
                      biopsies, the older skin looked better than at the beginning of the study – less sun damage, less inflammation and more collagen. Even more interesting to me were the genetic testing findings. To somewhat simplify the
                      complicated findings in the study, basically what happened is the genes turned on when we get old were getting turned off, and the genes that are turned on when we are young and tell us to make new collagen and healthy skin
                      were getting turned on again. It’s much more detailed in the study, but I’m a simple girl so I’ll stick with that summary.

                      Back to Benjamin Buttons. The first thing that crossed my mind when I read the study and saw the results was Benjamin Buttons because you truly do age in reverse all with a simple treatment using broad band light that has no
                      downtime. We are so in love with this treatment at Prime we offer a discount for a package of 3. Once you complete the package, all future treatments are half price. It’s our Forever Young package!

                      We love our products, Botox, and filler, but I must say, if I had to choose just one thing for anti-aging, the BBL Photofacial would be it. Don’t believe me? Check out the Stanford study for yourself. I’m sure you will be as
                      impressed as I was which is why I want to share this with as many people as possible. By the way, the aging in reverse won’t be as extreme as the photos below of Benjamin Buttons. There are limits after all. I just wanted an
                      excuse to look for a photo of Brad Pitt to share with you. The one of him on the bike is quite nice I thought! But seriously, who doesn’t want to look younger in 10 years than you do right now? That’s the science behind

              <h1><b>Four Reasons to Give Micro-Needling a Try</b></h1>

              <p>If you pale at the thought of the word “needles,” don’t worry, micro-needling is nothing to get anxious about. On the contrary, micro-needling is a safe, relatively comfortable procedure that improves the appearance of wrinkles,
                acne scars and stretch marks. Here are four reasons to give micro-needling a try: Micro-needling doesn’t use chemicals, heat or toxins. […]
                <br><br>
                <span class="if" style="display: none;">

                  Micro-needling doesn’t use chemicals, heat or toxins. Micro-needling triggers your skin’s natural healing process in response to the micro-injuries produced by the needles. Your skin repairs itself by producing new collagen and
                  elastin.
                  <br><br>
                  Micro-needling doesn’t hurt. An anesthetic cream applied to your skin before the procedure numbs the area, so you barely feel the needles penetrate.
                  <br><br>
                  Micro-needling is safe. SkinPen, a micro-needling tool, can be used safely on many body parts, including your face, neck, décolletage, arms, hands, legs, abdomen and back. Because micro-needling is non-ablative, meaning there’s no
                  thermal injury to your skin, it leaves your epidermis (the protective top layer of skin) intact. Therefore, there is less risk of scarring and infections. Additionally, SkinPen was designed with several safety features:
                  <br><br>
                  An exhaust port prevents suction and reduces the risk of broken capillaries.
                  Sterile, disposable needle cartridges reduce the risk of infection.
                  Bio-Sleeve technology minimizes the possibility of cross contamination by preventing fluids from leaking beyond the micro-needle cartridge.
                  You won’t look scary after micro-needling. Micro-needling requires little downtime. With SkinPen, most patients experience slight swelling and pinkness/redness (like a mild sunburn) that usually resolves within 24 hours. You can
                  resume your normal makeup routine two to three days after your treatment. You won’t have to take time off work or cover your face until your skin heals.

              <h1><b>Turn Up the Volume in Your Cheeks With Voluma</b></h1>

              <p>IAs we age, our faces lose fat and the cheeks start to hollow. But that doesn’t mean your baby-faced days are a thing of the past. Turn up the volume in your cheeks with Voluma. Voluma, a filler that was recently FDA-approved, was
                specifically designed with cheek plumping in mind, and the results have been impressive. […]
                <br><br>

                <span class="iff" style="display: none;">

                  1. What is Voluma exactly?
                  Juvederm Voluma was approved by the FDA for treatment of age-related volume loss in the cheek area. This is the first filler to be approved for this purpose. Its main component Is hyaluronic acid — which is also found in Juvederm
                  Ultra, Restylane, Perlane, and Belotero — all FDA approved fillers.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  2. How does Juvederm Voluma differ from Juvederm Ultra?
                  Juvederm Voluma is a thicker, more viscous version of Juvederm Ultra which gives it more “substance”. The technical term for this property is called “G prime”.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  The higher the G prime, the better ability for the filler to lift and support skin and surrounding structures. Compared with Juvederm Ultra, Juvederm Voluma has about 10 times (10X) the G prime.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  3. What makes Voluma different than other facial fillers like Radiesse, Perlane and Restylane?
                  Radiesse, Perlane, and Restylane have higher G primes than Juvederm Voluma. And although, these other [fillers] are not approved for volume loss of the cheek, they are commonly used “off label” for this application.

                  <br><br>

                  An advantage of Voluma over Radiesse, Artefill, or Sculptra is that Voluma can be “erased” or dissolved with an easily-obtained enzyme called hyaluronidase. Although hyaluronidase is seldom used, it can give patients the piece of
                  mind that their results don’t have to last for a year if they aren’t happy.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  3. What is the procedure like for getting Voluma injected?
                  Being very thick and viscous, Voluma will need to be injected with large bore needles or blunt cannulas. It’s mixed with lidocaine (numbing medication) from the factory, so the procedure is very well tolerated.

                  <br><br>

                  4. How long can I expect Voluma to last?
                  It’s longevity is longer than most fillers, lasting up to two years in their clinical trials. At 2 years, 76% of patients were still satisfied with their Voluma results. Also, at 2 years, the average client’s perception was that
                  they looked 3 years younger since the Voluma treatment.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  5. How much Voluma will I need to volumize my cheeks?
                  The volume needed for correction varies from client to client, depending on their degree of volume loss. During the clinical trials, the average volume needed for correction was just over 6 cc’s.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  If you are ready to turn up the volume in your cheeks, Voluma is the product we would recommend. Schedule a complimentary consultation, and our nurse practitioner will explain the procedure and the results you can expect. It’s a
                  promise, once you learn how plumping your cheeks can erase years off your face, you will ready for treatment! If your curious about how you would look with Voluma, click here to try out the Juvederm Voluma free treatment visualizer

              <h1><b>Golden Rule</b></h1>

              <p>The Golden Rule… Do to others as you would have them do to you. After a very trying experience with a person I considered a friend, and who quite frankly, blind-sided me, it was an unexpected client that walked in the door who
                changed my attitude and turned my day from blah to FABULOUS. Here’s what happened… First […]
                <br><br>

                <span class="ifff" style="display: none;">

                  First a little explanation. Every client who walks through the door of Prime we hope to build a relationship with right from the beginning. With some of our clients, it goes beyond the clinical experience to a deeper level that
                  turns into friendship. We treasure those clients. Don’t get me wrong, first and foremost, we want to provide superior care and results, but it’s a bonus to get to know our clients beyond the condition of their skin. Sometimes that
                  just doesn’t happen, and we have to remind ourselves that you just can’t “click” with everyone. Some people don’t want conversation. They want to receive their treatment and leave. That’s okay too, and we can’t take it personally.
                  <br><br>
                  All that to say this. We had a client (I’ll call her Kelly) who came into our office from a special we ran on Living Social. When Kelly came in for her NanoPeel, we greeted her, offered her a drink and quickly brought her back to
                  our laser treatment room. Our esthetician, Twila, talked to her about her skincare history, explained the treatment she was about to receive and then proceeded to do the NanoPeel. Kelly quickly left the office after rushing Twila
                  through her post treatment instructions.
                  <br><br>
                  When I asked Twila about Kelly she predicted we wouldn’t see her again. Twila described Kelly as very matter-of-fact and cold. The experience was very uncomfortable for Twila and left her questioning herself and wondering what she
                  could have done differently to make Kelly happy. Twila called Kelly a couple of days later to follow-up on her treatment and again, Kelly was less than friendly though she reported all was well with her skin.
                  <br><br>
                  Here it is a month later, and who walks through the door today but Kelly. She was driving by and wanted to stop by to let us know how pleased she was with her results. Not only that, she scheduled a more aggressive laser treatment
                  in September when she has more downtime. She praised us all, especially Twila, for being so kind to her on a day when she had received some very bad news and was not in a good frame of mind.
                  <br><br>
                  My conversation with Kelly reminded me once again that all we can do is be polite and kind to everyone even when they don’t seem very receptive and things get awkward. You never know what’s going on in someone’s life. We must also
                  understand that we aren’t going to click with every person we encounter and that’s okay. No matter what, all we can do is live by the Golden Rule. No matter what your beliefs, the Golden Rule is one we should all live by. The world
                  would be a much better place.

              <h1><b>Vitamin C For Youthful Skin</b></h1>

              <p>Vitamin C plays an important role in maintaining healthy skin. Young skin is full of vitamin C, but over time, skin naturally loses this nutrient. Other factors such as exposure to UV light, pollutants, and cigarette smoke compound
                the loss of vitamin C and contribute to signs of aging. The good news is there are ways […]

                  Wrinkles
                  <br><br>
                  One of the most powerful functions of vitamin C is its role in the production of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity. As you age, collagen breaks down and wrinkles begin to form. Stabilizing your skin’s levels
                  of vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production.
                  <br><br>
                  Age Spots
                  <br><br>
                  When it comes to treating age spots, chemical peels and lasers are the recommended treatments to achieve results quickly. But it turns out vitamin C can deliver results too over a period of time. Age spots are essentially sun
                  damage and vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin. While it’s not a replacement for sunscreen, vitamin C protects against and may repair UV
                  damage like discoloration and fine lines.

                  The crying began at the start of my son’s senior year and pretty much continued until after the graduation ceremony. I was doing pretty good, and thought I was finally ready to let go — until yesterday. With 2 weeks remaining until
                  we move him to Colorado, the crying has started again, only worse. Now when we sit down for dinner, it hits me that he won’t be with us at the table every night much longer. I see him sleeping and realize I won’t have my son in his
                  room every night much longer. I know he’ll be home for breaks, but those will be visits. His home will now be in Colorado. Of course, I’m excited for him and very proud of what he’s accomplished, but now I realize that like it or
                  not, I’m entering a new phase in my life, and I better get on board with that fact. Raising kids has been a rewarding adventure, but new adventures await.
                  <br><br>
                  Okay, along with all the emotions that come with sending your youngest off to college, comes the realization that you’re getting old. I may feel like I’m in my 20’s, but one look in the mirror reveals the truth. Fortunately, I work
                  at Prime Medical Spa and know about the latest and greatest anti-aging treatments. I plan on taking advantage of everything we offer and along with that, I’m committing to a healthier lifestyle (only two diet DPs a day) which
                  includes drinking lots of water, exercising and eating right. If I’m going to start a new life adventure (whatever that may look like), I’m going to look and feel good doing it! Seriously, I believe that anyone going through a life
                  transition should focus on looking and feeling their best. I also plan to let God lead the way for whatever future plans He has for my life. The nest may soon be empty, but I know the future will be full of blessings.

              <p>Your face is our specialty at Prime Medical Spa. The reality is that we are all destined to age and have wrinkles though some may age more gracefully than others. Many factors from genetics to lifestyle can determine how quickly we
                age. Some just go with the flow and accept lines and wrinkles and others are determined […]
                <br><br>
                <span class="sep1511" style="display: none;">Many options are available to erase years off your face. Though many celebrities deny it, BOTOX, is the their best kept secret. The good news is Botox is affordable for the average person.
                  What is Botox? Botox is an FDA approved treatment to help relax and smooth expression lines around the eyes and forehead. This painless procedure is quick and easy and can be done in as little as 30 minutes. If deeper wrinkles and
                  volume loss are your main concern, we recommend choosing a dermal filler. Dermal fillers are FDA-approved injectables that help plump and smooth folds and wrinkles of the face. Most fillers last about 12-18 months. For those
                  wanting longer, lasting results, we recommend Bellafill. Bellafill is a dermal filler that works with your own body to produce collagen. It happens to be the longest lasting filler on the market and can outlast temporary fillers by
                  5 -10 years. Bellafill just received FDA approval to treat acne scars as well. Not sure what option is best for you? An appropriate product or combination of products is chosen during a complimentary consultation after your needs
                  and the severity of wrinkles are discussed.

                  <br><br>

                  Maybe injections aren’t for you or you have sun damage and age spots you want to address in addition to wrinkles and volume loss. Micro-needling, a variety of Sciton laser treatments and Peels are all great options to improve and
                  correct your skin’s tone and texture. We have a variety of treatment options available to fit your needs, skin-type, and time restraints.

                  <br><br>

                  If you’re going to invest in treatments, you’ll want to pair them with an at home regimen. Any provider in the skin care field will tell you that an at home regimen is crucial for best results. Instant gratification is great, but
                  it’s maintenance between treatments that helps to keep our skin looking fabulous. Our esthetician recommends using a retinol, a topical solution that helps to minimize fine lines and wrinkles and helps improve your skin’s overall
                  texture and clarity. Another great product to choose is something with growth factors. We suggest Biopelle‘s Tensage Serum. Growth factors help your skin by promoting collagen production. Collagen can begin breaking down as soon as
                  our late twenties and start causing wrinkles to form. We also insist our clients invest in a quality sunscreen. Sunscreen is the number one anti-aging product, and we have several to choose from. We love Revision’s Intellishade
                  tinted moisturizer with SPF 45 and several of the EltaMD sunscreens.

                  <br><br>

                  We accept aging is inevitable. Why not do it gracefully with the help of injections, lasers and skincare products. Consultations are always complimentary at Prime and our providers would be happy to talk with anyone considering a
                  change.

                  What makes Bellafill unique is that it’s a smooth, collagen-based filler with PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) microspheres. The PMMA re-creates the firm structure of younger looking skin by supporting production of your body’s own

              <h1><b>ENHANCE, CORRECT & CREATE SHAPE WITH FILLERS</b></h1>

              <p>The field of injectable fillers continues to expand with new products having been launched, existing products receiving additional FDA approval for new cosmetic indications, and others in the pipeline. Physicians are highly trained
                in using these cosmetic injectable fillers for a myriad of problems which patients may wish to address. Patients may achieve successful enhancement of scars and other concerns – from aging and other prior skin problems – and to
                create a youthful appearance by altering the shape of an aging face.
                <br><br>
                At Prime Medical Spa, we are excited to be an early provider of Bellafill® – the only dermal filler on the market approved for the correction of moderate to severe, atrophic, distensible facial acne scars. Because it is made
                partially from bovine collagen, a skin allergy test is required prior to receiving a Bellafill® treatment to make sure no allergies exist to the product or anesthetic lidocaine. This filler has been on the market since 2007 for
                correction of nasolabial folds, and it recently received approval for acne scars on cheeks. We have had outstanding results thus far and they are immediate. PMMA (the other ingredient in Bellafill®) creates a lattice structure
                encouraging more collagen to grow into it over time. If you want to learn more about our experience, schedule some time for a complimentary consultation. What excites us most about the filler is that results last 5+ years.
                <br><br>
                Juvederm® Ultra XC recently received approval for injection into the lips and around the mouth. This hyaluronic acid instantly adds fullness to the lips and is the only dermal filler that has proven results lasting up to one year for
                lip augmentation. Many patients may opt to address age related volume loss, contour, moisture and softness of their lips with the addition of this smooth injectable. The procedure is easily tolerable as Juvéderm® Ultra XC has
                lidocaine, which anesthetizes the area being treated. Results last up to 1 year.
                <br><br>
                Juvederm Voluma XC® is the first and only FDA-approved injectable gel for the cheek area. This filler contains a modified hyaluronic acid and instantly creates contour and a subtle lift to give a more youthful profile for up to 2
                years.
                <br><br>
                Radiesse® is dermal filler that temporarily adds volume to help smooth moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds. This calcium based filler works to add volume under the skin and instantly hide the signs of wrinkles and creasing.
                Over time, the benefits of Radiesse continue by stimulating your own natural collagen, providing additional structure after the initial effects of Radiesse have diminished. Results last about 1 year.
                <br><br>
                I hope that the above information may help you decide to come in for a complimentary consultation, and allow our doctor to help guide you toward the best injectable treatment to address your concerns.

              <h1><b>SkinPen Healing Process</b></h1>

              <p>The products you use during the SkinPen healing process are important for best results. One of the fundamental goals of skin rejuvenation is to revive the skin’s natural structures, namely collagen, elastin and extracellular matrix.
                The SkinPen micro-needling procedure accomplishes this goal by creating micro-injuries that trigger your body’s natural wound repair process. When your dermis is injured, your skin repairs itself by initiating a three-stage wound
                healing process that includes the remodeling of collagen. Here’s a breakdown:
                <br><br>
                Inflammation. When dermal tissue is pierced, your immune system springs into action. White blood cells, which include macrophages, disinfect the wound, remove debris and increase blood flow to the wound area. The swelling and skin
                redness you see after an injury are signs of inflammation. The maximum inflammatory response occurs during the first day after your SkinPen micro-needling procedure. Because inflammation is thought to play a key role in scar
                formation during the wound healing process, reducing inflammation is critical during this initial phase and throughout the 28-day healing process after micro-needling. Therefore, it’s important to avoid ingredients that increase the
                risk of inflammation and/or hinder the skin’s natural repair mechanisms, including:
                <br><br>
                <li>Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives</li>
                <li>Citrus-derived preservatives</li>
                <li>Parabens</li>
                <li>Sulfates (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate)</li>
                <li>Glycol (e.g., propylene glycol)</li>
                <li>Silicone/methicone/dimethicone</li>
                <li>Dyes</li>
                <li>Fragrance</li>
                <li>Petrolatum</li>
                <li>Mineral oil</li>
                <br>
                Prime offers topical post-micro-needling products formulated specifically to optimize the results of micro-needling. These products help to minimize inflammation during the 28-day skin remodeling process following the SkinPen
                micro-needling procedure and do not contain any of the irritating ingredients listed above.
                <br>
                Proliferation. This stage is when the repair process begins. The wound is re-built with new granulation tissue — a combination of cells, collagen and other extracellular matrix materials. Several important processes occur during
                proliferation:
                <br>
                Granulation. Fibroblasts (the cells of the dermis) move to the wound area. Fibroblasts produce collagen and elastin in the wound site, forming connective skin tissue to replace the damaged tissue. Healthy granulation tissue is uneven
                in texture. It does not bleed easily and is pink or red in color.
                <br>
                Revascularization. A new network of blood vessels develops to deliver the oxygen and nutrients your fibroblasts need during the reconstruction process.
                <br>
                The proliferation phase is short (approximately five to six days) after micro-needling because you’re not damaging very many skin cells. Micro-needling pushes the skin cells abrside with only minimal damage to the epidermis and
                dermis.
                <br>
                Remodeling. During the final stage, newly formed collagen is rearranged and converted from type III to type I. This type of collagen adds strength to the wound, and the process causes the dermis to contract slightly, pulling the
                wound edges together and closing the wound. This is like a shrink-wrap effect that tightens the skin. Most of the remodeling process occurs within one to six months of the SkinPen micro-needling procedure. Older individuals (55 years
                or older) may need longer for wounds to heal. Cell nutrition is very important during this remodeling stage which is why it’s so important provide key nutrients that your skin needs during remodeling, including vitamin C, vitamin A
                and copper peptides.
                <br>
                Your SkinPen provider will guide you in implementing a treatment regimen that will optimize your body’s natural wound healing process to give you healthier, more beautiful skin.

              <h1><b>Bellafill®</b></h1>
              <br><br>
              <p>If you have had facial fillers before, you may already know that their results are only temporary. This is due to your body’s natural ability to break down the filler, causing it to be absorbed back into your system. As a result,
                your wrinkles eventually return to their original state, forcing you to continuously return for more short-lived filler injections. This process can be both time consuming and very costly. Every year you spend more money to treat the
                same area.
                <br><br>
                However, Bellafill® is the first and only FDA-approved non-resorbable wrinkle filler for the correction of smile lines. Patients really are asking for significant lasting results. The secret is in its patented formula, which contains
                20% Bellafill® Precision-Filtered Microspheres™ and 80% Bellafill® Purified Bovine Collagen™ Gel with Lidocaine, an anesthetic.
                <br><br>
                The microspheres present in Bellafill® are made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), the same material used for dozens of medical implants over the last 50 years. Once injected into the wrinkle site, the microspheres provide a
                supportive, natural feeling structure that causes your wrinkles to be reduced, and in some instances may disappear permanently.
                <br><br>
                Is Bellafill® Right for You?
                <br><br>
                To determine if Bellafill® is right for you, schedule a complimentary consultation. To determine if you are an ideal candidate for Bellafill®, you will be given a skin test during your initial consultation. Individuals who are not
                good candidates for Bellafill® include those who have severe allergies, especially those that are allergic to bovine collagen and/or Lidocaine. If you are prone to hypertrophic scarring, or the formation of unusually thick scar
                tissue, this service may not be right for you. You must speak with our doctor to determine your eligibility for this procedure.
                <br><br>
                Bellafill® is an ideal choice for many individuals looking to reduce the appearance of the troublesome wrinkle lines surrounding the mouth, referred to as nasolabial folds. Bellafill® is FDA approved for use in the nasolabial folds,
                and off-label use of the product in other areas of the face is very common.
                <br><br>
                Benefits include:
                <br>
                Immediate, visible results with no downtime
                A simple, in-office procedure
                Treatments improve over the course of several months and last 5+ years
                Proven, safe, and effective
                How are the Results with Bellafill®?
                <br><br>
                Patients see immediate results and can resume normal activities. The most common adverse effects are some general discomfort, mild swelling, and reddening at the injection site.
                <br><br>
                Each patient is different, but most patients require an average of two to three injection sessions spaced over the course of three months. The spacing of the sessions allows the doctor to assess your collagen production for optimal
                aesthetic results. In clinical trials, patients showed continued and improved wrinkle correction for up to five years. Don’t wait to rediscover a younger looking you.

                      <p>Laser hair removal is an effective medical procedure using concentrated beams of light to remove unwanted body hair. While it can’t permanently stop hair from growing, it can slow it down considerably so that you can enjoy
                        smooth,
                        hair-free skin that lasts for several months at a time

                        As technology has developed to be more sophisticated, the effectiveness and safety of laser hair removal has improved massively. However, if you’re still concerned about how safe laser hair removal actually is, we’ve created
                        a
                        helpful breakdown of this issue. After all, safety is always an important consideration when choosing your health and beauty treatments.



                        HOW SAFE IS LASER HAIR REMOVAL?


                        In general, this method poses minimal risk to your health and the likelihood of any dangerous side-effects is very low. The majority of people who use this treatment will tell you that they experienced zero complications
                        afterwards
                        and that the results were fast and lasting.

                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <strong>Having said this,</strong> it is not unheard of that laser hair removal can cause certain adverse side effects, which we will explore below. The biggest risk to remember from the outset, however, is with using a
                          non-qualified practitioner.
                          <br>

                          Many stories you may hear about the dangers of laser hair removal will likely stem from untrained individuals who have not used the laser hair removal machines as they should. So make sure you always deal with experts in
                          the
                          field when it comes to achieving your beauty goals.

                          <br>


                          POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
                          <br>
                          <br>

                          As laser hair removal targets hair follicles with concentrated light beams, your body may react with redness or slight irritation. A feeling of tenderness may also be felt as well as a tingling sensation. You may not feel
                          anything at all, but if you do, it’s completely natural.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          These symptoms are usually short-lived and the targeted area may appear in a similar way to skin after it has recently been waxed. Ice packs or cooling gels can be applied to the area to speed up your skins the recovery
                          time.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Lasting issues may arise if your skin is scratched, rubbed or irritated in some way by your clothing. To avoid this, take care with your after treatment routine and apply moisturiser or take a cold bath if you feel your
                          skin is
                          overheating.

                          <br>
                          <br>

                          AVOIDING INFECTION

                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Similar to other hair removal methods such as shaving or waxing, damaging hair follicles could lead to an infection. This is unlikely to happen however, if you take care of your skin and avoid touching the area with dirty
                          hands
                          after the treatment.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          For those who do experience an infection from laser hair removal, it’s important to treat it like you would a cut. Don’t expose it to any harmful substances and leave it to heal on its own before undergoing any future
                          treatments.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Scarring, which is perhaps the biggest fear of many people who undertake laser hair removal, won’t occur as long as you receive the treatment from a qualified practitioner who will be able to review you skin type and the
                          course
                          of necessary treatments required for you to achieve the best results.

                          PROTECT YOUR EYES DURING LASER HAIR REMOVAL

                          <br>
                          <br>
                          The hair removal procedure uses powerful lasers to deliver its results. As such, there is a risk of serious eye injury if the machine is accidentally applied to your eyes. This may occur if you are removing hair from your
                          upper
                          lip or other parts of your face for instance. To avoid this, always wear the protective goggles provided by your beauty technician.

                        <p>A great Christmas gift is one that lasts. Far better than a predictable item of clothing or an unimaginative gift card, a facial treatment is a wonderful gift that keeps on giving as the winter weather starts to take a
                          serious
                          toll on our skin.<br>
                          The winter months present a whole host of challenges. From the harsh drying effects of central heating, to the colder winds that become more blustery and frequent, often people may find that their skin is more delicate
                          during this
                          time of year.

                            <strong>By ensuring that</strong> you take extra care of your skin during winter, you can help your skin’s natural glow to shine through. And if you’re stuck for a Christmas present, then the gift of a fortifying and
                            enjoyable
                            facial treatment may be the perfect treat for someone special!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            MAKE WINTER LESS HARSH
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The blustering cold winds of winter can be awful for your skin in many ways. And as the humidity levels drop, your skin is likely to suffer from the lack of moisture in the air and experience dryness and flakiness more
                            frequently
                            as a result. This also makes skin more vulnerable to harsh winds.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For men and women of all ages and skin types, winter can cause damage to your skin and intensify any skin conditions you might already have. One of the best remedies for this is a facial treatment that identifies your
                            skin’s
                            needs and works with it to restore its natural balance.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            RESTORE DEHYDRATED SKIN
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Winter is also a time where people turn up their heating to the max and take long hot showers and baths to relax after facing the cold during the day. While it’s hard to argue with the soothing and calming benefits of an
                            indulgent hot shower or bath, if you don’t take special care, it can actually be quite damaging for your skin causing dehydration and dryness.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As well as humidifiers and using slightly stronger moisturisers that can help to combat these effects, one of the best ways to keep your skin hydrated during winter is to book in for a facial treatment from a beauty
                            expert who
                            understands the science behind good skin.

                            HELP WITH YOUR HOLIDAY HABITS

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For many people, the holiday season comes hand in hand with some unfortunate bad habits. A time when comfort eating, lack of exercise and large, carb-heavy meals are plentiful, this all has an impact on your skin.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Of course, we’re not saying you should deny yourself your Christmas treats, but it is well worth remembering how certain foods such as sugary snacks, salty party foods and increased alcohol consumption could lead to more
                            winter
                            break-outs.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As well as keeping an eye on your overall diet and skin health, a great way to remedy the effects of your winter lifestyle is to undergo a rejuvenating facial treatment to balance out your skin’s oil levels and to
                            detoxify your
                            skin cells from unwanted toxins.

                        <p>Laser hair removal is an effective medical procedure that uses concentrated beams of light to remove unwanted body hair.

                          While this might not be your first method of choice, results have shown that it’s a highly sustainable way of achieving smoother skin. So much so, that thousands of women and men have traded their usual waxing or shaving
                          routines
                          for less frequent laser hair removal treatments.

                          The biggest barrier for people considering laser hair removal is still their lack of knowledge about what the process actually entails and whether it’s worth it. Let’s take a look at some of the important considerations for
                          those
                          contemplating a new tool in their beauty regime this winter.
                          <br>

                          <span id="3" style="display: none">
                            <strong>HOW FAST</strong> CAN I EXPECT RESULTS?
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Hairs may not fall out immediately, but you will gradually see a decrease over a period of days and weeks. And as your treatment plan continues, you will witness less hair growth in the targeted area.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Repeated treatments are usually necessary to ensure lasting hair removal. While the results will vary depending on your skin and hair type, as well as your beauty goals and how much of your body you are targeting with
                            laser hair
                            removal, you can expect to receive several different treatments over a course of weeks or months for the best effects.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Laser hair removal doesn’t completely stop hair growth, but it will slow it down to a rate that you won’t have to shave, wax or apply hair removal cream anytime soon.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If you want to achieve long-term removal over a number of years, you can arrange to have maintenance treatments that top up the effects of the initial treatment.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Some have experienced hair-free skin for several months following only minimal treatments, while others have noticed regrowth happen at a sooner rate. But all this depends on your treatment plan of choice, your type of
                            hair and
                            your hair removal goals. We’ll explain everything when you arrive!
                            <br>
                            <br>


                            IS IT WORTH IT?

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The main motivation to use laser hair removal treatments is to save time and discomfort from your weekly (or daily) hair removal regime. By considerably slowing down the growth of new hairs and removing hair from awkward
                            or
                            inconvenient places, you can enjoy the freedom of lovely smooth skin throughout the year.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It’s true that laser hair removal treatment plans are not as cheap as other hair removal options, but if you see it as an investment over a longer period of time, it may well be worth the cost.

                        <p>You might have an elaborate home skin care routine that helps you maintain healthy and clean looking skin, but sometimes it’s best to let the professionals take care of you every once in a while.

                          <br>
                          <br>

                          Far from a frivolous treatment that you could do yourself at home, a quality facial will actually identify the unique qualities of your skin – whether it is dry, sensitive, oily, normal – before implementing the most
                          suitable
                          treatment to bring out the best in your skin and help you glow.

                          <br>
                          <br>

                          Many people underestimate the impact that pollution, hormones, stress and other unavoidable elements can have on the health of your skin. An amazing facial can be the best way to fight off damage and signs of ageing and
                          keep you
                          looking fresh all year round.

                            <b>EXPRESS FACIAL</b>
                            Sometimes it’s hard to carve out enough time from your busy schedule to take care of your skin health. Our express facial is designed to give our clients the best possible treatment in only 30 mins. Whether you’re on your
                            lunch
                            break or passing by on your way home, the express facial will clean, exfoliate and deeply cleanse your skin through a personalised mask.

                            <b>DEEP HYDRATION</b>
                            One of the most common issues with skin is dehydration and lack of moisture. Rather than applying vast amounts of moisture on yourself each night, a deep hydration facial may be the best way to replenish your moisture
                            balance and
                            recover tired and stressed looking skin. This will help to reduce fine lines, soften your complexion and reduce the size of pores.

                            <b>ACNE AND ANTI-BLEMISH</b>
                            This is where our experienced knowledge as professional beauticians really comes into effect. By identifying your type of acne or skin condition, we can offer you the most suitable facial treatment that will help to
                            reduce any
                            uncontrolled breakouts, blemishes or blackheads. Usually it is a simple case of identifying the problem and restoring balance to your oil and moisture levels.

                            <b>DEEP CLEANSE</b>
                            If you’re looking for a full skin detox, our deep cleanse facial will be the best option for you. Reducing breakouts, clearing congested pores and generally achieving a fresher, cleaner look all starts with a deep
                            cleanse. We use
                            a special anti-blemish activator to steam and exfoliate away dead skin cells, bacteria and debris to let you reach optimal PH balance and benefit from clean, hydrated and smooth skin.

                            The T-shape treatment is designed especially for the removal of stubborn fat as well as the overall contouring of the body to reveal naturally beautiful form.

                            <br>
                            It is one of the only non-invasive methods for full body remodelling that can simultaneously remove unwanted body mass while tightening and lifting skin.

                            Although it has the potential to produce large scale transformations, it can also be targeted to treat small problem areas such as the upper arms, thighs, hips or abdomen – so it’s worth considering as an option whatever

                            As you age, your skin will naturally lose some of its elasticity in certain areas of your body. This treatment targets these areas by selectively applying heat to stimulate skin tissues and collagen fibres to reveal
                            smoother and
                            younger looking skin.

                            The vacuum massage is a popular anti-cellulite treatment method that aims to prevent and decrease the accumulation of cellulite deposits. It does this by stimulating the lymphatic system and encouraging the flow of
                            certain

                            Used both as a medical treatment for certain health issues as well as a beauty solution, vacuum massages can be a great way to achieve greater elasticity for your skin while allowing you to achieve your overall body

                            Low level laser therapy (LLLT) refers to the use of light for altering the biological activity of certain target areas of the body. Specific wavelengths are used to effectively stimulate tissues in the body resulting in
                            tissue

                            LLLT is often used as a treatment to alleviate the visible effects of aging by reducing skin wrinkles, fine lines, saggy skin and dryness that can be a result of sun exposure, diet or simply the natural effects of time.

                            The amazing T-shape treatment can be used to reveal firmer and younger looking skin that will accentuate the natural curves of your body. It does this by removing unwanted body mass and reducing the prominence of saggy

                        <p>Cryo fat freezing, sometimes referred to as ‘cool sculpting’, is a method of improving the natural contours of your body through targeted temperature treatments.

                          While it has been discussed widely within fitness, health and beauty circles recently, many people still don’t know exactly what it is and how it can help you.

                          This method of body contouring actually has a charming history – or so the rumour goes. Apparently, doctors once noticed that children who ate popsicles experienced fat reduction in their cheeks, sometimes leading to
                          dimples.

                          Even if you don’t believe that this alluring story was the origin of the today’s Cryo Fat Freezing treatments, it is true that extremely cold temperatures targeted at specific areas of the body can result in fat reduction.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Sometimes there are simply parts of the body that are hard to trim down, no matter how many miles you run each morning. Even for fitness enthusiasts and those who regularly partake in sporting activities, the natural
                            shape of
                            your body can create unwanted areas of excess weight.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Cryo Fat Freezing allows you to specifically eliminate stubborn areas of your body that prevent you from achieving your ultimate beauty and physique goals.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Cry Fat Freezing uses focused cooling to target fat cells in areas of the body that are difficult to burn with natural exercise and dieting. Over the duration of your treatments, your body will naturally process these
                            frozen
                            cells and remove them from your body.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            These cells gradually filtrate from the body through natural processes, resulting in a slimmer and more shapely body. As this happens, areas that are not directly targeted will not be affected, so you don’t have to worry
                            about
                            losing overall body weight in places that you want to keep it.

                            <br>
                            This method of treatment reduces excessive body fat and restores your natural shape. Depending on your goals, you can expect a reduced waistline and less bulging in areas of your body that are typically hard to eliminate.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The important thing to remember with this treatment is that it is not designed to reduce huge amounts of excessive weight. It is made for mild shaping and toning of your body.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            While the weight you lose through this treatment will not return on its own, you may gain additional weight in these targeted areas due to a high fat diet or lack of exercise.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Cryo Fat Freezing should be treated as a mild and helpful technique that you can use together with exercise and a balanced diet. Unlike other forms of body contouring that may involve invasive surgery or chemical
                            treatments, it
                            will not permanently transform your body.

                            <br>
                            This treatment is recommended for individuals who already have slender body shapes, but just need some extra help to achieve their ultimate body goals.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You shouldn’t see Cryo Fat Freezing as an alternative to exercise and a healthy diet, but simply a way to finish off your good work and keep you looking at your very best.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This is a perfect method for those who don’t want to use aggressive technology or treatments, but want to mildly improve their body’s curves and contours to create a naturally pleasing shape.

                        <p>Hair always grows back. That’s a fact. No matter how often you shave, it always returns, bringing with it unwanted itching and bad ingrowths. While waxing can be more effective, it’s an extreme method that pulls away the
                          protective layer of your skin along with your hair, causing irritation in addition to the sharp sting!



                          Cream that removes hair may seem like a more gentle option, but this is far from the truth. Skin irritation, allergic reactions, lingering smells and chemical burns are the side effects of certain depilatory creams. So
                          what’s the
                          solution?



                          While people associate laser hair removal treatments with pain, high cost and a humorous collection of bizarre side effects, it can actually be the best option to help you achieve healthy, smooth and hairless skin.



                          To illustrate this, we’ve gathered some of the most popular myths about the treatment in order to offer you some well needed hair removal education.
                          <span id="9" style="display: none">

                            It’s true that treatments for laser hair removal are more expensive than waxing or shaving products, but to simply end the conversation there would be short-sighted. The best way to view the cost effectiveness of this
                            treatment
                            is to weigh the price against the duration of its effects and the ability to avoid constant itching and irritation – not to mention the endless hours you accumulate waxing or shaving.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The number of trips to the parlour is small in comparison to the amount of times you will need to buy alternative hair removal products. Scheduling your treatments over a number of months or a year will ensure that you
                            never have
                            to worry about hair removal issues in the short term.

                            Also, the areas that you want to target are probably very small, such as your eyebrows or the upper lip, rather than large sections of skin. These treatments are relatively inexpensive if you consider how the cost is

                            This myth originates from the very first machines that were used for laser hair removal. When the technology first came out, it was known to cause damage to skin. Today the technology is much more advanced.

                            Some patients may feel a prickling or tingling sensation that causes moderate discomfort, but compared to the momentary pain caused by waxing, it really doesn’t compare.

                            <br>

                            With modern machines, discomfort is kept to a minimal and if you are particularly sensitive, you can even use a numbing cream. But this is usually unnecessary. Long term side effects are a thing of the past!

                            Laser hair removal works on all hair types, however in the past technology was not as effective at removing lighter hair types such as ginger. Things have changed a lot in the industry over the years and laser hair

                            Having said this, the best results can still be seen on darker hair colours. It will sometimes take an additional number of sessions to get the same results for lighter hair colours, but the effects can still be

                            Laser Hair Removal doesn’t cause increased hair growth rates or even denser hair growth. Each treatment should in fact cause a significant decrease of hair growth. This translates to the speed of growth as well as the
                            density and
                            thickness of the actual hair strands.

                            When hair eventually grows back after your treatment phases has ended, you hair will typically be much lighter and finer – so even if you stop your treatments completely, the areas you found to be the most troublesome in

                            At one point, this myth was actually true. Unfortunately, the technology of the past was not effective in treating darker skinned patients. This is because it is the melanin in the skin that is targeted to achieve the

                          in the park, or how many yoga sessions you book at the studio – it’s just not enough to transform those difficult areas of your body.

                          Luckily, various body contouring methods allow you to harness the wonders of science to boost your natural appearance and beauty, targeting the most troublesome areas of the body to leave you looking your best.

                          With today’s technology and scientific advancements in the field of medical beauty treatments, there are many types of body contouring methods available. But the perfect treatment for you will always depend on your body
                          shape,
                          goals and overall preferences.

                          When deciding what is best for you, make sure you seek advice from a reputable centre with professional and caring beauticians who can design the optimal personal treatment plan for you.

                              The T-shape treatment, which includes the combined power of Radiofrequency, Laser LTT and vacuum treatment at the same time, is one of the most effective treatments in the market today. This is down to its ability to
                              reveal
                              more firm, smooth and toned skin over your body’s natural curves.

                              Cellulite and stubborn fat is incredibly difficult to remove from certain areas of your body, including your thighs and lower back, which leaves many people feeling frustrated, even if they’ve dedicated many early hours

                              Another effective method on the market is Cryo Fat Freezing, a great way to destroy fat cells by freezing them. Though fewer people know about the benefits of this method, it nonetheless has some amazing potential to

                              and heat
                              to dissolve fat.

                              Infrared technology heats up cells inside the body, up to 7cm below the skin. This targets areas of stubborn fat deposits, increasing fat metabolism. Also known as the slim press, or the lymphatic massage, this
                              treatment can be
                              perfect for those who want to slim down this summer, and remove excess waste and toxins – all without the use of invasive surgery.

                              Effectively, this method uses ultrasound to produce heat vibrations that target fat cells. This creates vibrations and dissolves fat cells resulting in their eventual removal through the lymphatic urinary systems.
                              Finally, a

                              The U-Curve or Lipo Laser treatment is the perfect option for those who want to reduce the appearance of fat with subtlety and care. With no needles, injections or invasive surgery needed, this method transmits low

                              to penetrate the skin, making fat cells “sweat” water, glycerol and fatty acids.

                              Fat cells are forced to shrink and fatty liquids are removed through the lymphatic system to leave the body in better shape. Though this is considered a mild treatment, it can still produce substantial results within

                              treatment, with a potential visible reduction of up to 3 inches.
